# ASE230-Team-website
Class project for ASE 230
Jacob Doerr
I have worked on this part of the project individually, so I have completed the first two bullets on the assignment. If you would have liked me to complete all three instead, let me know and I will edit and resubmit. Thanks!
There were issues uploading both the assets folder and the favicon.ico file. Neither required any modification for this code, and can be found in the recent submission if necessary. Sorry for the inconvinience.
